      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The structure of a unicellular organism, is made up of the cytoplasm
          and organelles enclosed by a plasma membrane. This unicellular unit is an organism which shows
          living characteristics. When a water sample of a pond or hay extraction is observed using a
          microscope, unicellular organisms can be observed easily.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">In a unicellular organism, organelle level organization can be seen.
          The origin of a multicellular organism is from a single cell, the zygote which is the product of
          the fertilization of an egg with a sperm</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The bodies of the multicellular organisms are composed of different
          types of cells. Those cells are important in different functions.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">A multicellular organism possesses a tissue and a system level
          organization. The organs of the organism are well developed and designed to carry out relevant
          functions.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The smallest structural and functional unit at living condition is the
          cell. A group of cells modified to perform a specific function is called a tissue. A collection of
          tissues form an organ, a collection of organs forms a system, and systems collectively form an
          organism.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Below chart shows the organisational levels of an organism considering
          the blood circulatory system.</span></p></div>
