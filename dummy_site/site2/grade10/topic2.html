      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Protein is an essential constituent in all living cells. Carbon(C)
          Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O) and Nitrogen (N) are always present in proteins. Sometimes Sulphur can
          also be present.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">17% of the mature human body is composed of proteins. Protein is a
          complex molecule made up of polymerized amino acid molecules. Meat, fish, egg white cereals are
          some of the foods rich with proteins.</span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: large;">As an energy source</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">When energy supply from Lipids and Carbohydrates is not sufficient
          protein is used in energy generation. </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">To make structural components Proteins are important components
              in making cell membrane. Hairs and feathers also contain keratin protein. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">As enzymes All the bio-chemical reactions take place in
              organisms are catalyzed by enzymes. The enzymes are proteins.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">As hormones Some hormones are proteins which involve in
              homeostasis and coordination of organisms.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">As antibodies The antibodies that are produced in the body to
              protect the body against microorganisms that enter into the body are proteins.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Enzymes </span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The special proteins (organic catalysts) that are produced within the
          organism to increase the rate of bio-chemical reactions are known as enzymes. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">For example to convert Sucrose into Glucose, Sucrose has to be heated
          with a dilute acid. But the enzymes present in the digestive system do the same reaction at a low
          temperature. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Therefore the activity of enzyme is to catalyze the bio-chemical
          reactions.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The blue colour of the drop obtained from the mixture gradually
          reduces with time and finally obtains the colour of Iodine (yellow /brown colour) Starch gives
          black blue colour with Iodine but it does not give colour change with Iodine after 20 minutes as
          there is no Starch there. That is because Starch is converted to Maltose by Amylase enzyme.
