      <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Cell growth</span></strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Growth is a basic feature of organisms. Growth of a cell is the
          irreversible increase of size or dry mass. But a cell has a maximum limit to grow. Beyond that
          level the cell will not grow, instead it divides.</span></p>
      <p><strong>● <span style="font-size: large;">Cell division </span></strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The cell has the ability to grow and multiply its number. Accordingly
          a cell can multiply into two, four and eight cells. By multiplication new cells are formed. The
          cells multiply by cell division.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The cell division is the process by which new cells are formed by the
          division of cellular materials. To complete the cell division of an eukaryotic cell, first the
          nucleus should divide and then the cytoplasm. Chromosomes contain and transfer genetic materials,
          the inherited characters from generation to genaration (Before the division of nucleus).</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The number of chromosomes in an ordinary somatic cell of a species is
          constant. That is specific to a species. Example - There are 46 chromosomes in a chromosomal set of
          human somatic cells. This is comprised of 23 pairs of chromosomes. The same hereditary information
          is born by each pair of chromosomes. A pair of chromosomes which contains same heriditary
          information is called as homologous pair of chromosomes. One of these homologous chromosomes is
          inherited from father where as the other is from mother.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Accordingly a child inherits 46 chromosomes receiving 23 chromosomes
          from father and 23 chromosomes from mother. The cell division takes place in 2 methods.</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Mitosis </span></p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Mitosis</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">It is the type of division which multiplies the number of cells by
          maintaining a constant number of chromosomes in the cells. First the nucleus divides and then the
          cytoplasm divides to produce two identical daughter cells equal to mother cell.</span></p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The cell division that halved the number of chromosomes is the
          meiosis. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The meiosis takes place during formation of gametes (eggs and sperms)
          in higher organisms. After the gametes being fused, the number of chromosomes of a species should
          be maintained, constant. For that the number of chromosomes should be halved during the formation
          of gametes and become n (haploid).</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Eggs and sperms possess only one chromosome of each pair of
          chromosomal set. (2</span><sub><span style="font-size: large;">n </span></sub><span
          style="font-size: large;">-&gt;</span> <span style="font-size: large;">n) When these gametes fuse
          to form the zygote, the chromosomes become n + n -&gt;2n again.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Meiosis takes place in 2 stages. The first stage is a meiotic division
          (reduction division) and the next is a mitosis.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">During meiosis, structural changes occur in chromosome. Therefore, new
          variations or new characters appear in organisms and this is a very important phenomena in
          evolution.</span></p>
