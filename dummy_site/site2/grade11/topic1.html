      <p><span style="font-size: large;">You may have observed that plant tissues are of different forms.
          Animal tissues are also of different forms. It is observable that different cell types are present
          in living beings and similar cells are arranged together. A group of cells with a common origin
          that has been modified to perform particular functions in the body is known as a tissue.</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-size: large;">We can identify the nature of a growing root from the above
          observation. Growing part is soft and light coloured. Mature part is rough and dark coloured. This
          is because of the nature of tissues.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Plant tissues can be categorised using different criteria. Plant
          tissues can be divided into two groups according to the ability of cell division. </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Meristematic tissues </span></p>

      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Permanent tissues can be found in region B-B' and Meristematic tissues
          in region A-A' as shown in figure</span></p></div>
