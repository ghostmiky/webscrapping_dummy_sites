      <p><span style="font-size: large;">A tissue that lost its ability to divide and specialized to perform a
          particular function is known as a permanent tissue. According to the nature of the permanent
          tissues, it can be grouped into two.</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Simple Permanent tissues - One type of cells collected together
            </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Complex Permanent tissues - Different types of cells collected
              together </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Simple permanent tissues The tissue is composed of similar
              cells. According to the shape of cell and the nature of cell wall, three types of simple
              permanent tissues as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma can be identified in
              plants</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Parenchyma</span></strong></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The tissue that forms the soft parts of the plant body is the
          parenchyma tissue. This is the most abundant tissue found in the plant. </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Features of Parenchyma tissue</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Parenchyma tissue consists of living cells.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cells are isodiametric (spherical) with a large central vacuole.
            </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Nucleus is present peripherally in the cytoplasm. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">The cell wall is thin and made up of cellulose.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Intercellular spaces are present.</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Locations of parenchyma tissues</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cortex and pith of plant stem </span></p>

          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Leaves (mesophylls)</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Functions of parenchyma</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Photosynthesis - Palisade and spongy mesophylls in plant leaves
              contain chlorophyll within chloroplasts. Photosynthesis takes place within these
              chloroplasts. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Food storage - Food is stored in some parenchyma tissues and
              they are called as storage tissues. </span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">E.g. : Potato tuber, Carrot and Sweet potato roots, Papaw and Banana
          fruits. </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Storage of water - Specially xerophytic plants store water in
              Parenchyma tissue. </span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">E.g. : Aloe leaves, Bryophyllum leaves, Cactus cladode </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Providing support - Herbaceous plants like Balsam absorb water
              into vacuoles of the parenchyma cells. Thereby cells become turgid and provide mechanical
              support to the plant.</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Collenchyma</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Collenchyma tissue provides mechanical strength and support to the
          plant body. They are modified parenchyma cells.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Features of collenchyma tissue</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Collenchyma tissue consists of living cells.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cells possess a cytoplasm, nucleus and central vacuole. </span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Generally cells are elongated and polygonal in cross section.
            </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">The corners of the cell walls are thickened. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Intercellular spaces may present or may not present.</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Locations of collenchyma</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The collenchyma forms a cylindrical tissue inner to the epidermis of
          herbaceous stems. They are found in the veins of dicot leaves.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Functions of collenchyma </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">1' Support - Collenchyma provides mechanical support to dicot plant
          stem, before the formation of wood.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">(Provides mechanical support to herbs) This tissue provides support to
          the plant leaves by the collenchyma in veins.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">2' Photosynthesis - Chloroplasts are found in the collenchyma of
          immature dicot stems. Photosynthesis is carried out by those cells.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Sclerenchyma</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Sclerenchyma tissue helps in providing mechanical strength and support
          to the plant body. This tissue has two types of cells as sclereids and sclerenchyma fibres. </span>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Features of sclerenchyma tissue</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Sclerenchyma tissue consists of dead cells. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Lignin is deposited on the cellulose cell wall. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cells are tightly packed. Therefore, no intercellular spaces.
            </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cell wall is evenly thickened and forms a central lumen.</span>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Locations of sclerenchyma tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Fibres present in xylem are called as xylem fibres and in phloem as
          phloem fibres. Other than above, coconut fibres, agave fibres and cotton wool are made up of fibres
          (sclerenchyma)</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Selereids are found in endocarp of coconut, Kaduru and mango fruits,
          the pericarp of guava fruit and in pear fruit and seed coat of coffee and dates.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Functions of sclerenchyma</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Provide support to the plant body</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Complex permanent tissues</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Different types of cells together form a complex permanent tissue. Two
          complex permanent tissues as xylem and phloem can be identified in plants</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Xylem and phloem are found in vascular systems of root, stem and
          leaves of the plant.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Xylem tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">This tissue is composed of four different types of cells. </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Xylem vessel element </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Tracheids </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Fibres </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Parenchyma cells</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Xylem vessel elements are cylindrical elongated cells. Xylem vessel
          element stack on top of the others and the cross walls are dissolved to form a continuous xylem
          vessel. This tubular structure helps in transportation of water in plants. Tracheids are elongated,
          spindle shaped cells. They also help in transportation of water. Xylem fibers are narrower and
          shorter than tracheids. Xylem vessels,</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">tracheids and xylem fibers become dead due to lignification of cell
          walls. They provide support to the xylem tissue. Xylem parenchyma are living cells with a thin cell
          wall. They involve in food storage.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Functions of xylem</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Transportation of water and minerals to the plant body which are
              absorbed by plant roots. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Providing of mechanical support to plant body</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Phloem tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Phloem tissue is composed of four different types of cells. </span>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Sieve tube elements</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Companion cells</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Phloem fibres </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Phloem parenchyma</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The sieve tube elements fuse end to end and the cross walls are
          incompletely dissolved to form a sieve tube. The cross walls in these sieve tubes are called sieve
          plates. Sieve tubes transport food (mainly sucrose) throughout the plant, as a solution. Companion
          cells are elongated cells associated with sieve tube elements. The nucleus of the companion cell
          controls the activities of the sieve tube elements (sieve tube elements lack a nucleus). Sieve tube
          elements, companion cells and phloem parenchyma are living cells whereas phloem fibres are dead and
          found scattered in phloem tissue</span><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>. </strong></span>

      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Functions of phloem tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">The food synthesized in the leaves are transported throughout the
          plant body by this tissue (Translocation)</span></p></div>
