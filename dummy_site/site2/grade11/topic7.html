      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Muscle tissue is one of the main tissues that makes up the human body.
          Muscle tissue is made up of muscle cells or muscle fibres. These muscle fibres possess contraction
          and relaxation ability. Not like epithelial tissue, the muscle tissue possesses a good blood
          supply. Therefore muscle tissue receives oxygen and nutrients at a high rate. Muscle tissue acts as
          one of the effectors in responding in coordination.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Muscle tissue is of three types,</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Smooth muscle tissue </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Skeletal muscle tissue</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cardiac muscle tissue</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Smooth muscle tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Smooth muscle tissue is made up of smooth muscle cells. This tissue is
          found in the walls of organs with cavities. Example :- Walls of digestive tract, uterus, blood
          vessels and bladder </span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Features of smooth muscle cell</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">These cells are spindle shaped. The cells are unbranched</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">These cells have one nucleus at the centre. No striations
            </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">These cells do not become fatigue quickly. They are controlled
              involuntarily</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Skeletal muscle tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Skeletal muscle tissue is made up of skeletal muscle fibres. These are
          mostly associated with skeletal system. The skeletal muscles help in locomotion and movements of
          chordates.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Features of skeletal muscle fibers</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Skeletal muscle fibres are long, cylindrical, unbranched
              cells.</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">They are multinucleate cells with striations. The nuclei present
              peripherally, and many mitochondria are present. </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">These cells are voluntarily controlled and become fatigue
              easily.</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Cardiac muscle tissue</strong></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cardiac muscle tissue is made up of cardiac muscle cells. It is
          exclusively found in the vertebrate heart.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Features of cardiac muscle fibres</strong></span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Cardiac muscle cells are uninucleate, striated and short cells
            </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">Intercalated discs are present among cells </span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">They never become fatigue. They contract rhythmically</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><span style="font-size: large;">They are involuntarily controlled</span></p>
        </li>
